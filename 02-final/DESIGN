One of the games that demonstrates the basics of systems is Mafia. It involves writing and storing wills each night 
(in case you are killed) and having a communal text chat during the day to lynch the member of the town that could be a serial killer
or part of the mafia. The mafia wins by eliminating innocent town members and the serial killer wins by eliminating everyone in the town. 

A computer acts as a server for all players to connect to with a maximum of (6 to 8) players during a connection period. 
The game starts once an acceptable amount of players have connected. Users will be assigned roles and names and the first 
night phase begins. They can choose to perform a special action (depends on role) or write in their will during this 30 second phase. 
After the night phase is over, players will have 5 minutes to talk with the rest of the town by text communication to decide which player 
to kick out of the game through a vote. If no players are lynched, the next night begins until a group wins (town, mafia, or serial killer). 

We will hold player information in a struct where we have to allocate memory. We will include the use of files, shared memory,
and semaphores for the text documents that need to be stored such as player will statements and the town chat. Signals will be
used to terminate a client connection to the server. Pipes will be used in combination with networking to establish a connection
from our multiple clients to the server. The project will be broken down into networking, main game (time keeping, reading and writing), 
player handling (structs, interactions). These roles will eventually be split between the three of us or redivided.
